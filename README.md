# Description

With this plugin installed, you can easily add/remove tags by pressing the color buttons on your Stream Deck. You can also choose to use the color wheel, which is a single button, so there is more space left on the Stream Deck. The color wheel will let you tap through the colors Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Gray. Furthermore you can create a button for assigning a custom tag, which you can give any label you want, and in addition to that you can give the custom tag a color too.

It's made for *macOS* only.

# Features

- 7 color buttons for quickly adding a color tag to the selected files.
- A color wheel, which rotates the color in the following order: ```Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Gray```

- A single button for clearing all tags from the selected files.
